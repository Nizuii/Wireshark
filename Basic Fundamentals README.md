The internet uses TCP/IP protocol (Set of rules on how data is transfered over an internet). And in this TCP/IP network the data is not sent in one piece. Instead the datais first broken down into smaller chunks called **data packets**. 

#### Why does the internet use data packets?
- The reason fpr using data packets is to make the internet run smoother and more efficient.
- If internet didnt use data packets and instead it sent all the data together in a long uninterrupted stream of bits and inorder for the data to be read, those bits whould have to be sent in the correct order and this method is what we call **circuit switching**. But a problem with it is that during the transmission of the data no other computers will be able to use those lines until the transmission is complete.
